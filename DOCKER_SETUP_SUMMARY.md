## How It Works

### Automatic Docker Image Building and Publishing

When you push code to your GitHub repository, the following happens automatically:

1. **On pushes to main branch**:
   - Backend and frontend Docker images are built
   - Images are tagged as `latest`
   - Images are pushed to DockerHub (if credentials are configured)

2. **On tag pushes (e.g., v1.0.0)**:
   - Backend and frontend Docker images are built
   - Images are tagged with the version number
   - Images are pushed to DockerHub (if credentials are configured)
   - A GitHub release is automatically created

3. **On pull requests**:
   - Backend and frontend Docker images are built
   - Images are NOT pushed to DockerHub (for security)

### Manual Release Process

To create a new release:

1. Make sure you have configured DockerHub credentials in GitHub Secrets
2. Run the release script:
   ```bash
   # On Linux/Mac
   ./scripts/publish-release.sh 1.0.0
   
   # On Windows
   .\scripts\publish-release.bat 1.0.0
   ```

This will:
- Update version numbers in package.json files
- Create a git tag
- Push the tag to GitHub
- Trigger the GitHub Actions workflows
- Build and publish Docker images
- Create a GitHub release

## Required Configuration

To enable automatic publishing to DockerHub, you need to set up secrets in your GitHub repository:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Click on "Secrets and variables" in the left sidebar
4. Click on "Actions" tab
5. Add the following secrets:
   - `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`: Your DockerHub username
   - `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`: Your DockerHub access token

To generate a DockerHub access token:
1. Log in to DockerHub
2. Go to Account Settings
3. Click on "Security" tab
4. Click "New Access Token"
5. Give it a name (e.g., "GitHub Actions")
6. Copy the generated token and add it as `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` in GitHub secrets

## Using Published Images

Once the images are published, anyone can use them by:

1. Using the production docker-compose file:
   ```bash
   # Create .env file with your DockerHub username
   echo "DOCKERHUB_USERNAME=your-username" > .env
   
   # Run with the production compose file
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```

2. Or pulling the images directly:
   ```bash
   docker pull your-dockerhub-username/dormdeals-project-backend:latest
   docker pull your-dockerhub-username/dormdeals-project-frontend:latest
   ```

3. Using them in docker-compose.yml:
   ```yaml
   services:
     backend:
       image: your-dockerhub-username/dormdeals-project-backend:latest
       # ... other configuration
     
     frontend:
       image: your-dockerhub-username/dormdeals-project-frontend:latest
       # ... other configuration
   ```

4. Running with Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Benefits of This Setup

1. **Automation**: Images are built and published automatically
2. **Versioning**: Proper versioning with semantic versioning
3. **Traceability**: GitHub releases document each version
4. **Reproducibility**: Anyone can use the same images
5. **Efficiency**: Users don't need to build images locally
6. **Consistency**: Same images used in all environments
